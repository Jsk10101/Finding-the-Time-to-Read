# Finding-the-Time-to-Read

The motivation of this project is two main things:

1) Understand how the average ratings of genres change over time, both on month and year long time scales

2) Analyze the number of monthly ratings for a genre to forecast future popularity of the genre

The code itself is reading in the over 2 million book long data file from Goodreads, splitting this data by its catagorical genre and then forecasting using different timescales, tools, and tests that were tried during the writing process. 

This is all formulated into a final report in a LaTeX style and a poster set up for presentation. These files go into incredible detail about this project and the process, so for more information, check those out.
